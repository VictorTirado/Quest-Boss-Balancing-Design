##**Quests:**

###**Brief introduction:**

A quest can be defined as a difficult journey towards a goal.

The most common quests are those 6:

•	**Kill quests:** You are sent to kill a certain number of enemies.

•	**Combo Quests:** You must make certain attacks in the order you are told (normally used in tutorials).

•	**Delivery Quests:** You are told to bring an item from one place to another.

•	**Gather Quests:** You are told to obtain certain items to complete the quest.

•	**Escort Quests:** You have to follow an NPC and protect him from enemies.

•	**Hybrids:** Those quests are the ones that combine other type of quest to make a more complex quest.
