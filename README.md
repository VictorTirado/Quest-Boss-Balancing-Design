This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).”

## **Quests:**

### **Brief introduction:**

A quest can be defined as a difficult journey towards a goal.

The most common quests are those 6:

- **Kill quests:** You are sent to kill a certain number of enemies.

- **Combo Quests:** You must make certain attacks in the order you are told (normally used in tutorials).

- **Delivery Quests:** You are told to bring an item from one place to another.

- **Gather Quests:** You are told to obtain certain items to complete the quest.

- **Escort Quests:** You have to follow an NPC and protect him from enemies.

- **Hybrids:** Those quests are the ones that combine other type of quest to make a more complex quest.

### **How quests are designed:**

In order to make a quest, professional teams, normally, have many quest designers, who are the ones in charge of thinking about new quests and in case that the quest is a side quest they also can make the plot behind their quests.

Much of the professional developer teams make a lot of stories before they start working on the game. Those stories are normally documented in the GDD (Game Design Document). This is helpful for the quest designers, because it allows them to take the story that is already created to integrate it in their quest. It also means that in games we can only see a little part of all the story ideas that were made for it.

Once the quest designer is convinced of an idea it is told to other members of the quest design group, to get feedback and when the idea is ready it is sent to the Lead Quest Designer. In case that the lead considers it to have potential for the game, the quest designer can go ahead and work on it.

In order t explain all the phases involved in the quest design I’m going to use the points that Philipp Weber (Quest Designer at CD Projekt Red) uses in his paper [MAKING GAMES CLASSICS: QUEST DESIGN IN THE WITCHER 3: WILD HUNT](http://www.makinggames.biz/feature/quest-design-in-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt,6896.html).

-	**Implementing the quest:**
In this phase the quest designers write all the dialogues involved in the quest, they decide NPCs involved (normally they also describe them, because they aren’t already created).

-	**Level structure:**
Here is where the quest designers decide how the NPCs involved in the quest will act. They can decide where the NPCs will be, if they will be able to interact with them when you want or only at certain hours, etc. Thanks to this they can give to the player a more immersive experience.

-	**The quest phase:**
Now the designers start to connect all what they have already, so they can set when and where happens everything, when every dialogue starts, etc. In this phase the organization is very important, cause other quest designers and QA workers must be able to understand it.

-	**Under close scrutiny:**
In this point the prototype is already done and is when it’s tested to see if everything is correct. In this case it is sent to the Quest Design Lead. If he approves it, it’s sent to the story team. The story team will rewrite it.

- **Working with other departments:**
This is probably one of the most important points. It’s not exactly a phase, because it’s done during the hole process of the quest design. It’s very important that the quest designers are in contact and work with other departments such as artists, sound designers, QA and many others.

### **Points to take in count when designing a quest:**

If you want to design a quest you should thin previously about the plot behind it, the requirements to complete it and the rewards it gives. The reason for that is because when you are designing a quest you should try to make the quest interesting for the player in order to give him reasons to complete the quest. If you the quest has nothing to say, or makes players consider it not worth it to complete due to the low reward in relation to the difficulty players won’t be happy doing them. If players aren’t happy they are bored and that’s the opposite of what you want in a videogame.

### **Step by step process:**

These steps aren’t mine, they are a combination of two articles I found on the internet. The first four steps are from an article in wikiHow called [How to Make a Video Game Side Quest](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Video-Game-Side-Quest) and the rest are from E.M.·WELSH, called How to [Write Your First Video Game Quest](https://www.emwelsh.com/blog/video-game-writing-guide). Even though the steps aren’t mine, the explanation of each steep is mine.

   **1.	Think of the plot, the characters, and what are the tasks for the player:** You must think what the quest is about and what the player have to do in order to complete the quest. Have in count that the plot and the objectives must have a relation, otherwise it won’t have any sense for the player. As an example of this you can think about a quest given by a child that asks you to find his/her parents. With this the normal objective would be finding his/her parents as she asked you, but if the objective was to kill the parents it wouldn’t be a good quest, cause the plot and the objectives wouldn’t have any relation.

   **2.	Decide how the quest will start:** You must decide how the player will find this quest. Will it be an object, maybe an NPC or will it be a letter? This is more important that it can seem, because it helps to the immersion of the player in the game. Think for example of a quest that is supposed to tell you something about an old treasure hidden years ago. This quest would be really cool if it starts with a map you find in the world, but if the quest was given by a child it wouldn’t have the same effect.

   **3.	Think about the body of the quest:** This step can be confused with the first step, but it’s different. While the first step made you thin about the objectives this one is about how to complete the objective. I’ll use the same example as in the first step to explain this. The child asked you to find his/her parents (objective). Then, this step is about how to find the child parents. Maybe you must ask people around the village about the parents, or maybe you have to follow some footprints. This is what this step refers to.

   **4.	Think about the quest ending or reward:** This step is where you must have in count the difficulty and the time required in order to complete the quest. You must think how you want that the quest ends. Continuing with the quest of finding a child’s parents, there could be many endings, maybe you want that the player finds them, maybe you prefer that they are dead or maybe you end the quest without finding them it gives you another quest to continue a quest chain until you find them. And when you are thinking of the rewards you must have in count that if they must be considered by the player a fair reward, because if the player doesn’t think the reward is worth the effort and time he won’t do the quest, or he’ll feel disappointed.

   **5.	Introductory paragraph:** This step is where you start writing the quest how the player will see it. In this step you have to write the plot of the quest briefly. It’s very important to write it in a way that it can catch the player interest. Maybe you think that this is not that important, but it is, because is the first impression the player has of the quest. As an example, you can think about the same example we’ve been carrying in the previous steps. Would you rather do the quest if it says “I don’t know where are my parents” or if it says “My parents disappear 3 days ago and I don’t know what to do. Nobody wants to tell me what happened to them”? Well my strength is no writing so both options are pretty awful, but I think you can make an idea of why this is important.

   **6.	Set up the location:** Maybe you already know where is happening the quest, but if you don’t is time to think about it. You must have in count that the place where the quest happens is very important, because it’s another way to immerse the player into the game.  And it’s also important the fact that maybe the plot of a quest is amazing, but if it’s in a place it makes no sense the quest won’t be as good as it should. As an example, let’s use the one I said about a hidden treasure in the step 2. If the treasure was hidden by a pirate it makes sense, it’s in an island or near the coast. But if it was inside a volcano in the middle of the continent it wouldn’t be credible.

   **7.	Make all the content needed to do the quest:** Here is where you polish the quest. You must write everything that NPCs can tell you related to the quest, or letters you can find that talk about it. Also, items related to it that can help you find out how to complete the quest. All of this is very important that is ready before implementing the quest into the game.

I highly recommend reading the article [How to Write Your First Video Game Quest](https://www.emwelsh.com/blog/video-game-writing-guide). It also talks about dialogue trees, which can be very useful if more people are working with you and have to understand how the dialogues of the quest will work.

### **Common mistakes:**

There are many common mistakes when designing a quest. The most common is not giving importance to the plot. Another common mistake is making the quest just to guide the player. Using a quest to guide the player and make him go where you want isn’t bad. The problem is when the quest has only this purpose, because when it happens it has no plot and in consequence it has no interest for the player, a part that the player feels pressured to make something. Other mistakes are using the same plot with little changes many times in the game, because it makes the player feel that he’s doing all the time the same and it will bore him. In my opinion this are the most common mistakes.

## **Bosses**

### **How to design a boss:**

This following design tips are taken from the article 7 Essential Ingredients for an Unforgettable Boss Battle. You can find it in the webpage [mentalblockgaming](http://mentalblockgaming.com/blog/game-design/boss-fights/). Even thought the tips are from the page I’ll explain them with my own words.

-	**Constant threat:** The boss must keep the player under tension due to the danger it supposes. This is very important to make the boss feel challenging.

-	**Puzzle:** A boss fight is like a puzzle. This is because it should be difficult and have special mechanics. The player must find the way to beat the boss using their brains and not going just for strength. The reason to it is that if the boss can be killed just with strength it can feel boring for the players.

-	**Mastery:** This means that the player should have knowledge of the games mechanics to defeat a boss. This is accomplished making a boss that requires the player to use a variety of things he has learned during the game.

-	**Believability:** The player must believe the information he can obtain of the boss. This means that if the boss has any weakness it must be something the player must believe. For example, let’s take a giant golem. The golem is made of rocks, but it has a point where it is weak. If the weak point is a place in his body where it has a crack it is easy to believe, but if it is in part of his body that seems like the rest of the body the player won’t believe it is a weak point and he won’t try to attack at this part of the golem’s body.

-	**Learning curve:** The boss must have a learning curve. This means that the boss should let the player adapt to him, so he can learn about the boss. This is accomplished by not letting the boss use all his abilities at the beginning of the fight, it must use them progressively during the fight. At a latest stage of the fight it can use all the abilities, cause the player must know already about them and how to counter it.

-	**Phases:** It’s important that the boss has different stages during the fight. The reason is that a boss with different phases feels less plain and if it’s well designed and balanced it will be funnier for the player, a part of being more satisfactory for the player.

-	**Aesthetics:** It refers at how the boss looks like. But not only the appearance, it also refers of the environment where the battle took place, and the sound. Think about fighting a king. The fight would be better in a castle than in the middle of the desert. The sound should also change respect the rest of the game. All of this is to make the boss fight more immersive.

The last tip I can give is that when you are designing a boss you should think about the best boss you’ve ever fight. Think why it was so great and try to make a boss that feels like the one you enjoyed.

### **Points to take in count when designing a boss:**

When you design a boss, you must have in mid that it has to be challenging and fair. It can be accomplished by using patterns in the attacks of the boss. It’s also important to think of stages that the boss should have, because a boss without stages can feel plain and boring. 


Make a boss that let you play with the player feelings. With this I mean that the boss should scare the player or intimidate him. Even it could make the player laugh, letting him underestimate the boss. You can even transform an NPC that during the game has been helping the player to make him feel betrayed.

Another thing to have in count is that the boss must feel unique. This means that it must feel different from normal enemies and even from other bosses.

Also, the boss must be a reward for the player or a goal that he wants to beat.

### **Step by step process:**

These steps are taken from the article [How to Make a Video Game Boss](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Video-Game-Boss) from wikiHow. But as with all the article I’ll explain it with my words and I’ll try to give explanatory examples.

   **1.	Make sure the boss fits with the current level's theme:** This means that the boss you design must have a relation with the environment that surrounds it. The easiest way to explain it is through an example, so I’ll use Ragnaros from World of Warcraft. Ragnaros is a fire elemental and the fight takes place in The FireLands. It makes sense, a fire elemental in a place full of fire. But now imagine Ragnaros in the middle of an ocean. It would make zero sense and it will break the immersive feeling of the game.

   **2.	Make sure it's harder than the average enemy:** The boss must be harder than all the enemies in it’s level, otherwise it won’t feel like a powerful enemy. This can be accomplished by giving the boss more variety of attacks. It can also be accomplished by giving the boss a huge amount of HP, but I don’t recommend it, because the player will feel that it’s boring and in the case the player dies and has to start the boss fight again he won’t be in the mood of doing it.

   **3.	How difficult the boss should be should depend on what point in the game it's encountered:** This is an important step. The difficulty of the boss must be equal to the level where the boss fight takes place. This means that it must be more difficult than the previous boss, but easier than the next boss. As an example, think about a game of three levels. If the first level boss is the most difficult than the second and third bosses, you will feel that the game is turning easier while you are playing. If this happens the game will be getting boring while the player opens his path through the levels.

   **4.	Not every level has to have a boss:** This is not really a step, but it’s an important tip. If you are designing a game, you must have in mind that the fact of placing bosses in all the levels is not an obligation. If you’ve made a level that’s enough challenging and makes the player feels satisfied when he finishes it you don’t need a boss, because maybe it will break the good level design.

   **5.	Sometimes make the boss fight complex:** Don’t take me wrong, all the boss fights should be complex, but not all of them needs to have incredibly complex mechanics. Maybe the boss is enough to make the fight challenging, or maybe the player needs to make some things in order to be able to defeat the boss. Think for example in a boss that can be challenging enough with it’s attacks and its stages, it doesn’t need that the player goes to use certain objects in the room to defeat him, but if the boss doesn’t feels challenging enough you can make the player use some objects in order to make the fight interesting.

   **6.	Make sure the music changes from the normal level tune to the boss tune:** The sound is very important when creating an immersive experience, so it’s a must when designing a boss. When the boss appears, the music should change to make the player know that he’s in front a powerful enemy that will put him in some troubles. To make it easier to understand, you just have to take a game and fight the same boss twice, one with audio and the other one without audio. You will realise that the audio has a huge impact in the experience, it can even make feel the battle more difficult than it really is.

   **7.	If possible make every boss' tune its own:** It’s not good repeating the same music in every boss fight, because the player will lose the feeling of fighting a special boss different from the others in the game. This can also be said about the looks of the boss. You shouldn’t use the same boss with colour changes, because it will happen the same as with the music.

   **8.	Make sure as the boss' health gets lower it actually begins to vary its attacks:** This is basically the fact of giving stages to the boss. This is important to make the boss feel unique and challenging.

   **9.	Give the player a reason to fight your boss:** The player must feel that there’s a reason to fight the boss, even if it’s due to the lore or for the drop it has. For example, you can think about Arthas from World of Warcraft. This boss combines two reasons why the player wants to fight him. The first is the fact that it’s the most important enemy during it’s expansion and the second reason is for the loot it has. Even today much people fights him every week just to obtain an item it droops.

   **10.	Don't restrict yourself when making the boss:** Well this is basically the fact that you don’t have to limit yourself when designing the boss. You can become crazy when designing the boss, use all the resources you want for it, if something is not related with the rest of the level give it a reason to be there using the lore of the game.
