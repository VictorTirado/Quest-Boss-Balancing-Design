## **Quests:**

### **Brief introduction:**

A quest can be defined as a difficult journey towards a goal.

The most common quests are those 6:

- **Kill quests:** You are sent to kill a certain number of enemies.

- **Combo Quests:** You must make certain attacks in the order you are told (normally used in tutorials).

- **Delivery Quests:** You are told to bring an item from one place to another.

- **Gather Quests:** You are told to obtain certain items to complete the quest.

- **Escort Quests:** You have to follow an NPC and protect him from enemies.

- **Hybrids:** Those quests are the ones that combine other type of quest to make a more complex quest.

### **How quests are designed:**

In order to make a quest, professional teams, normally, have many quest designers, who are the ones in charge of thinking about new quests and in case that the quest is a side quest they also can make the plot behind their quests.

Much of the professional developer teams make a lot of stories before they start working on the game. Those stories are normally documented in the GDD (Game Design Document). This is helpful for the quest designers, because it allows them to take the story that is already created to integrate it in their quest. It also means that in games we can only see a little part of all the story ideas that were made for it.

Once the quest designer is convinced of an idea it is told to other members of the quest design group, to get feedback and when the idea is ready it is sent to the Lead Quest Designer. In case that the lead considers it to have potential for the game, the quest designer can go ahead and work on it.

In order t explain all the phases involved in the quest design I’m going to use the points that Philipp Weber (Quest Designer at CD Projekt Red) uses in his paper MAKING GAMES CLASSICS: QUEST DESIGN IN THE WITCHER 3: WILD HUNT (link in the bibliography).

-	**Implementing the quest:**
In this phase the quest designers write all the dialogues involved in the quest, they decide NPCs involved (normally they also describe them, because they aren’t already created).

-	**Level structure:**
Here is where the quest designers decide how the NPCs involved in the quest will act. They can decide where the NPCs will be, if they will be able to interact with them when you want or only at certain hours, etc. Thanks to this they can give to the player a more immersive experience.

-	**The quest phase:**
Now the designers start to connect all what they have already, so they can set when and where happens everything, when every dialogue starts, etc. In this phase the organization is very important, cause other quest designers and QA workers must be able to understand it.

-	**Under close scrutiny:**
In this point the prototype is already done and is when it’s tested to see if everything is correct. In this case it is sent to the Quest Design Lead. If he approves it, it’s sent to the story team. The story team will rewrite it.

- **Working with other departments:**
This is probably one of the most important points. It’s not exactly a phase, because it’s done during the hole process of the quest design. It’s very important that the quest designers are in contact and work with other departments such as artists, sound designers, QA and many others.

### **Points to take in count when designing a quest:**

If you want to design a quest you should thin previously about the plot behind it, the requirements to complete it and the rewards it gives. The reason for that is because when you are designing a quest you should try to make the quest interesting for the player in order to give him reasons to complete the quest. If you the quest has nothing to say, or makes players consider it not worth it to complete due to the low reward in relation to the difficulty players won’t be happy doing them. If players aren’t happy they are bored and that’s the opposite of what you want in a videogame.
