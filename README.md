## **Quests:**

### **Brief introduction:**

A quest can be defined as a difficult journey towards a goal.

The most common quests are those 6:

- **Kill quests:** You are sent to kill a certain number of enemies.

- **Combo Quests:** You must make certain attacks in the order you are told (normally used in tutorials).

- **Delivery Quests:** You are told to bring an item from one place to another.

- **Gather Quests:** You are told to obtain certain items to complete the quest.

- **Escort Quests:** You have to follow an NPC and protect him from enemies.

- **Hybrids:** Those quests are the ones that combine other type of quest to make a more complex quest.

### **How quests are designed:**

In order to make a quest, professional teams, normally, have many quest designers, who are the ones in charge of thinking about new quests and in case that the quest is a side quest they also can make the plot behind their quests.

Much of the professional developer teams make a lot of stories before they start working on the game. Those stories are normally documented in the GDD (Game Design Document). This is helpful for the quest designers, because it allows them to take the story that is already created to integrate it in their quest. It also means that in games we can only see a little part of all the story ideas that were made for it.

Once the quest designer is convinced of an idea it is told to other members of the quest design group, to get feedback and when the idea is ready it is sent to the Lead Quest Designer. In case that the lead considers it to have potential for the game, the quest designer can go ahead and work on it.

In order t explain all the phases involved in the quest design I’m going to use the points that Philipp Weber (Quest Designer at CD Projekt Red) uses in his paper [MAKING GAMES CLASSICS: QUEST DESIGN IN THE WITCHER 3: WILD HUNT](http://www.makinggames.biz/feature/quest-design-in-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt,6896.html).

-	**Implementing the quest:**
In this phase the quest designers write all the dialogues involved in the quest, they decide NPCs involved (normally they also describe them, because they aren’t already created).

-	**Level structure:**
Here is where the quest designers decide how the NPCs involved in the quest will act. They can decide where the NPCs will be, if they will be able to interact with them when you want or only at certain hours, etc. Thanks to this they can give to the player a more immersive experience.

-	**The quest phase:**
Now the designers start to connect all what they have already, so they can set when and where happens everything, when every dialogue starts, etc. In this phase the organization is very important, cause other quest designers and QA workers must be able to understand it.

-	**Under close scrutiny:**
In this point the prototype is already done and is when it’s tested to see if everything is correct. In this case it is sent to the Quest Design Lead. If he approves it, it’s sent to the story team. The story team will rewrite it.

- **Working with other departments:**
This is probably one of the most important points. It’s not exactly a phase, because it’s done during the hole process of the quest design. It’s very important that the quest designers are in contact and work with other departments such as artists, sound designers, QA and many others.

### **Points to take in count when designing a quest:**

If you want to design a quest you should thin previously about the plot behind it, the requirements to complete it and the rewards it gives. The reason for that is because when you are designing a quest you should try to make the quest interesting for the player in order to give him reasons to complete the quest. If you the quest has nothing to say, or makes players consider it not worth it to complete due to the low reward in relation to the difficulty players won’t be happy doing them. If players aren’t happy they are bored and that’s the opposite of what you want in a videogame.

### **Step by step process:**

These steps aren’t mine, they are a combination of two articles I found on the internet. The first four steps are from an article in wikiHow called [How to Make a Video Game Side Quest](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Video-Game-Side-Quest) and the rest are from E.M.·WELSH, called How to [Write Your First Video Game Quest](https://www.emwelsh.com/blog/video-game-writing-guide). Even though the steps aren’t mine, the explanation of each steep is mine.

   **1.	Think of the plot, the characters, and what are the tasks for the player:** You must think what the quest is about and what the player have to do in order to complete the quest. Have in count that the plot and the objectives must have a relation, otherwise it won’t have any sense for the player. As an example of this you can think about a quest given by a child that asks you to find his/her parents. With this the normal objective would be finding his/her parents as she asked you, but if the objective was to kill the parents it wouldn’t be a good quest, cause the plot and the objectives wouldn’t have any relation.

   **2.	Decide how the quest will start:** You must decide how the player will find this quest. Will it be an object, maybe an NPC or will it be a letter? This is more important that it can seem, because it helps to the immersion of the player in the game. Think for example of a quest that is supposed to tell you something about an old treasure hidden years ago. This quest would be really cool if it starts with a map you find in the world, but if the quest was given by a child it wouldn’t have the same effect.

   **3.	Think about the body of the quest:** This step can be confused with the first step, but it’s different. While the first step made you thin about the objectives this one is about how to complete the objective. I’ll use the same example as in the first step to explain this. The child asked you to find his/her parents (objective). Then, this step is about how to find the child parents. Maybe you must ask people around the village about the parents, or maybe you have to follow some footprints. This is what this step refers to.

   **4.	Think about the quest ending or reward:** This step is where you must have in count the difficulty and the time required in order to complete the quest. You must think how you want that the quest ends. Continuing with the quest of finding a child’s parents, there could be many endings, maybe you want that the player finds them, maybe you prefer that they are dead or maybe you end the quest without finding them it gives you another quest to continue a quest chain until you find them. And when you are thinking of the rewards you must have in count that if they must be considered by the player a fair reward, because if the player doesn’t think the reward is worth the effort and time he won’t do the quest, or he’ll feel disappointed.

   **5.	Introductory paragraph:** This step is where you start writing the quest how the player will see it. In this step you have to write the plot of the quest briefly. It’s very important to write it in a way that it can catch the player interest. Maybe you think that this is not that important, but it is, because is the first impression the player has of the quest. As an example, you can think about the same example we’ve been carrying in the previous steps. Would you rather do the quest if it says “I don’t know where are my parents” or if it says “My parents disappear 3 days ago and I don’t know what to do. Nobody wants to tell me what happened to them”? Well my strength is no writing so both options are pretty awful, but I think you can make an idea of why this is important.

   **6.	Set up the location:** Maybe you already know where is happening the quest, but if you don’t is time to think about it. You must have in count that the place where the quest happens is very important, because it’s another way to immerse the player into the game.  And it’s also important the fact that maybe the plot of a quest is amazing, but if it’s in a place it makes no sense the quest won’t be as good as it should. As an example, let’s use the one I said about a hidden treasure in the step 2. If the treasure was hidden by a pirate it makes sense, it’s in an island or near the coast. But if it was inside a volcano in the middle of the continent it wouldn’t be credible.

   **7.	Make all the content needed to do the quest:** Here is where you polish the quest. You must write everything that NPCs can tell you related to the quest, or letters you can find that talk about it. Also, items related to it that can help you find out how to complete the quest. All of this is very important that is ready before implementing the quest into the game.

I highly recommend reading the article [How to Write Your First Video Game Quest](https://www.emwelsh.com/blog/video-game-writing-guide). It also talks about dialogue trees, which can be very useful if more people are working with you and have to understand how the dialogues of the quest will work.

### **Common mistakes:**

There are many common mistakes when designing a quest. The most common is not giving importance to the plot. Another common mistake is making the quest just to guide the player. Using a quest to guide the player and make him go where you want isn’t bad. The problem is when the quest has only this purpose, because when it happens it has no plot and in consequence it has no interest for the player, a part that the player feels pressured to make something. Other mistakes are using the same plot with little changes many times in the game, because it makes the player feel that he’s doing all the time the same and it will bore him. In my opinion this are the most common mistakes.

## **Bosses**

### **How to design a boss:**

This following design tips are taken from the article 7 Essential Ingredients for an Unforgettable Boss Battle. You can find it in the webpage [mentalblockgaming](http://mentalblockgaming.com/blog/game-design/boss-fights/). Even thought the tips are from the page I’ll explain them with my own words.
